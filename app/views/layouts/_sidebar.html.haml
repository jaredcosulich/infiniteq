      %b The Implications
    %p
      Please ask as many questions as possible, even if you
      know the answer (and if you know the answer then just
      answer it yourself as well). The goal is to map out all
      possible questions.

      %b The Rules
      %ul
        %li Every possible question is valued, even closely related questions.
        %li You can write an answer to your own question. This is valued as well.
        %li
          No question should ever be dismissed if a similar question has already been answered.
          You can provide a link to the existing question, but never suggest that the question
          should not have been asked.

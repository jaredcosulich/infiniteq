        %p
          Ask (and try to answer) all possible questions about a specific topic.

        %p (this means every possible phrasing of every question)
        %p (this is likely impossible)
        %p (we want to try anyways)
        %p (it could really help people learn)

        %h5 The Rules
        %p Every possible question is valued, even closely related questions. (including different wording)
        %p You can write an answer to your own question. This is valued as well.
        %p
          No question should ever be dismissed if a similar question has already been answered.
          You can provide a link to the existing question, but never suggest that the question
          should not have been asked. All questions are valued.
        %p
          Personal attacks are not welcome and will be removed immediately.
